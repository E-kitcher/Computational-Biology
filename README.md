## Aim: 
Explore the causes of cancer from a Kidney Cancer database.

## Project Description
The report details my investigatition into 3 Kidney cancers along with normal samples from the TCGA TARGET GTEx cohort. The cancer types are Chromophobe, Clear Cell and Papillary. I investigated the structure of the data using dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering, followed by linear models to find similarities between the cancer types. Then, Random Forest Classifiers and Decision Trees to find the most important features which differentiate and predict these cancers. 

The PDF document details the results and what machine learning algorithms were used. 

The ipynb file contains the code used for analysing the data. 

Note: some editing of the data sets was done on excel for convenience before using python.
